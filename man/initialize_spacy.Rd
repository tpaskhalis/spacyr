=======
Check the availablity of spaCy on the user's system, as well as the 
availability of spaCy model for English. This function has to be executed 
before running \code{tag()}.  This function not only checks the availability,
but also sets options to the path where spaCy is installed, in case the user
has more than one version of Python installed, or is using a virtualenv.

\section{Setting the path to the python executable}{
 Note that on some 
  systems, notably OS X / macOS, you may have installed a different version 
  of Python from that included in the base system.  OS X / macOS installs a 
  slightly older version of 2.7.x by default, for instance, in 
  \code{/usr/bin/python}.  Using homebrew, you may have installed a different
  version that gets placed in \code{/usr/local/bin}.  Even when this is 
  working at a command line (e.g. bash in the Terminal), when called from R 
  it may still look for \code{usr/bin/python}. This function finds the python
  executable with spaCy and set the path to it.
