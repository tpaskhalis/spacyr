\section{Setting the path to the python executable}{
 Note that on some 
  systems, notably OS X / macOS, you may have installed a different version 
  of Python from that included in the base system.  OS X / macOS installs a 
  slightly older version of 2.7.x by default, for instance, in 
  \code{/usr/bin/python}.  Using homebrew, you may have installed a different
  version that gets placed in \code{/usr/local/bin}.  Even when this is 
  working at a command line (e.g. bash in the Terminal), when called from R 
  it may still look for \code{usr/bin/python}. This function finds the python
  executable with spaCy and set the path to it.
  
  If you installed spaCy in a virtual environment, you need to specify the 
  path to the virtual environment python in the \code{which_python} argument. 
  To check the path to the python in a virtual environment, 
  1) activate virtual environment, 
  2) type "which python"
  3) copy and paste the output in R (e.g. \code{check_spacy(which_python = "/path_to_virtual/python")})
